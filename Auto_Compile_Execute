For C++ 
Step 1 : Create a file , say exec.sh with content as 
		g++ <program_name.cpp> -o program_name && ./program_name
	 Make it executable => chmod 744 exec.sh
Step 2 : On terminal => find . -name 'program_name.cpp' | entr -c ./exec.sh

Now , as soon as you edit the file program_name.cpp , contents of exec.sh will
be executed.

For Java
Replace contents of exec.sh with 
	javac program_name.java && java program_name
On terminal => find . -name 'program_name.java' | entr -c ./exec.sh

For Python
No need of exec.sh
Simply add "#!/bin/bash" to start of your script.py file and
find . -name 'script.py' | entr -c python3 script.py
