VIRTUALBOX

1) Problem 1

To be able to add a USB to VirtualBox => sudo adduser USERNAME vboxuser
Then logout and login for it to  have an effect

After installing VirtualBox fresh , it gives an error on trying to run a guest OS .
Soln => Install VirtualBox Extension Pack

2) Networking modes

NAT : VM connects to external network through 
	VirtualBox NAT Engine via Host as proxy
	For each VM a new NAT network is created .
	For each VM , no access from outside network
		    , no network between host and VM
		    , no network between VMs
	Can create connection from host to VM on a port 
	(by port forwarding , which didnt work for some reason) .
	However ping won't work by port forwarding cuz of some ICMP blah blah.

NAT Network :
	Other than a network is created between VMs ,
	everything is same as NAT

Bridged Adapter : Each VM gets an IP like the Host and can be
		  seen from router settings
	Access from outside network
	Network between Host and VM
	Network between VMs
	Access to external network/Internet

Internal Network :
	Network of VMs , but no access outside

Host-Only : 
	Connection from Host to that specific VM only.

Host-Only : 
	Access from outside network <= No
	Network between Host and VM <= Yes
	Network between VMs	    <= Yes
	Access to external network/Internet <= No
