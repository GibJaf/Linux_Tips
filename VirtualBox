4) Networking modes

NAT : VM connects to external network through 
	VirtualBox NAT Engine via Host as proxy
	For each VM a new NAT network is created .
	For each VM , no access from outside network
		    , no network between host and VM
		    , no network between VMs
	Can create connection from host to VM on a port 
	(by port forwarding , which didnt work for some reason) .
	However ping won't work by port forwarding cuz of some ICMP blah blah.

NAT Network :
	Other than a network is created between VMs ,
	everything is same as NAT
	For each VM
		Access from outside network 	    => No
		Network between host and VM 	    => No
		Network between VMs	    	    => Yes
		Access to external network/Internet => Yes

Bridged Adapter : Each VM gets an IP like the Host and can be
		  seen from router settings
	Access from outside network	    => Yes
	Network between Host and VM	    => Yes
	Network between VMs		    => Yes
	Access to external network/Internet => Yes

Internal Network :
	Network of VMs , but no access outside
	Access from outside network 	    => No
	Network between Host and Vm 	    => No
	Network between VMs		    => Yes
	Access to external network/Internet => No

Host-Only : 
	Network of Host and VMs but VMs can't be accessed from outside
	Access from outside network 	    => No
	Network between Host and VM 	    => Yes
	Network between VMs	    	    => Yes
	Access to external network/Internet => No

5) VirtualMachine not occupying the entire screen on entering Full Screen mode
Soln => 
	i)   sudo apt update
	ii)  sudo apt-get update
	iii) Restart the machine
	iv)  sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
	v)   In the VirtualMachine menu bar click on Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image.
	   It will open a window . There click on Run. A new terminal window will open and stuff will install automatically.
	That's it . If it still doesn't occupy full screen , try a restart . That will definitely make it work.
