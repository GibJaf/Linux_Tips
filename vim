1) To write to file :
	Press "i" to enter INSERT mode . Now you can write , delete , do whatever else .

2) To close or exit Vim ( Many people find this difficult , I don't know why )
	Press Esc to exit the INSERT mode . Then either 
		1) Type ":q!" to exit vim without saving changes .
		2) Type ":wq" to save the changes and exit vim .	

3) To undo all changes made in current session 
	Press Esc to exit INSERT mode .
	Then type ":e!" followed by Enter key .
